# Basic-Portfolio

This is my week one project. Also, this is where I will keep notes to myself about the code.

Things to figure out:

Floating Text over images in the portfolio
how to make a form and have said form successfully work!


Things to do:

html
I think my HTML is  finished.

css
Problems.
fonts
background colors for containers and sections
the arrangement of the nav bars so that it doesn't look like a 5 year old did it.
